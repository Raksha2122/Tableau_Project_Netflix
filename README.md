# Tableau_Project_Netflix
I developed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that analyzes Netflix‚Äôs movie and TV show catalog with a focus on additions by year. The project involved importing and visualizing over 6,000 rows of data, including key attributes like titles, directors, cast, release year, rating, and categories.

üîç Key Features:

Visualized Netflix content additions by year and type (TV shows or movies).
I created a geographic map showing the distribution of movies and TV shows by country.
I designed a Top 10 shows dashboard based on unique show IDs.
Developed various visualizations, including stacked bar charts and packed bubbles.
I applied quick table calculations to generate insights such as percentage distributions.
I incorporated data on total titles by genre, ratings, and duration for an in-depth analysis.

üé® Design Enhancements:

Customized the dashboard with Netflix‚Äôs signature theme for a cohesive visual identity.
Fine-tuned formatting by adjusting colors, labels, and text styles.
Optimized layout for clear analysis, including the addition of key metrics like total movies, top genres, and ratings data.

This project honed my skills in data visualization, dashboard design, and Tableau functionalities to create an engaging and informative dashboard.
